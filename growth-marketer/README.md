# Challenge

Croct currently has a solid client base in Brazil, which uses our personalization platform to create unique user experiences and optimize buyers' journeys.

Now, we are beginning to expand our presence in the USA.

We already have a standard traction strategy that includes traditional channels like LinkedIn Ads, Meta Ads, SEO, events, communities, social media, etc.

But as a resourceful, curious, and inquiring growth marketer, what approach would you take to go beyond that?

How would you ensure that you generate leads in this new market by exploring these channels in a disruptive way?

Which other channels would you leverage, and what unique strategies would you implement on each of them?

Justify your choices by explaining your thought process and showcasing your ability to craft a long-term strategy independently.

*Monthly numbers*
- Marketing budget: $10,000 per month
- Target cost per marketing lead: $40
- Goal: bring 250 leads in one month

*ICP*
- CROs, CMOs, Marketing VPs, or growth managers working for B2C SaaS PLG companies (their user acquisition is usually more focused on the website rather than on the mobile app) that have:
  - From $10MM to $20MM on revenue
  - At least five people on the growth team (usually 50 to 500 people in the whole company)
  - A dedicated developer for the growth team
  - A website with more than 50k MAU

*Target industries*
- Financial services

- Travel
- Beauty

Always remember that the goal of this challenge is to understand your strategic thinking and assess your skills for thinking outside the box.
